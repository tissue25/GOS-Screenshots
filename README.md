# Usage model

In this usage model the Sandboxed Google Play and Services is only installed inside the Private Space in the main profile. This approach is useful if you want Google sevices to run on your main profile only when you need it. You don't have to unnecessarily change between the user profiles. Also file sharing is more easier than running a separate user profile for Google services.
